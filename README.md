# Project Overview

This project includes a login and user management system using Next.js, Tailwind CSS for styling, and API routes for handling authentication and user data.

## Features

Login Page: Users can log in with a username and password.
User Page: Displays basic user information after logging in.
Account Creation: Allows users to create an account with an email, username, and password.

Please use "username" as Username and "password" as Password to login.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NodokaHirata/login-app.git
cd https://github.com/NodokaHirata/login-app.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

 Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
